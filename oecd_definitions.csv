Predictor	Definition
Perceived feedback	The index of teacher feedback (PERFEED) was constructed using students’ responses to a trend question (ST104) about how often ( “never or almost ever”, “some lessons”, “many lessons”, “every lesson or almost every lesson”) the following things happen in their language-of-instruction lessons: “The teacher gives me feedback on my strengths in this subject”; “The teacher tells me in which areas I can still improve”; and “The teacher tells me how I can improve my performance”. Positive values on this scale mean that students perceived their teachers to provide feedback more frequently than did the average student across OECD countries.
Assessing credibility	The PISA 2018 questionnaires included three scenarios assessing students’ knowledge of strategies for “Understanding and remembering” (undrem, ST164), “Summarising” (metasum, ST165) and “Assessing credibility” (metaspam, ST166). Metaspam was newly  developed for PISA 2018. Each scenario consists of (a) a stem which is a reading task and  (b) a set of strategies. Students were asked to rate how useful the strategies were for solving the reading task. All strategies were also rated by reading experts via multiple pairwise comparisons. This rating resulted in a hierarchy of all strategies for each task based on all the pairs agreed upon by at least 80% of the experts. For the new metaspam scenario (based on question ST166), for example, the experts’ ratings resulted in the following order: Q02HA, Q04HA, Q05HA > Q01HA, Q03HA. The final scores assigned to each student for each task ranges from 0 to 1 and can be interpreted as the proportion of the total number of expert pairwise relations that are consistent with the student ordering. The higher the score, the more a student chose an expert-validated strategy over a less useful one. Finally, all three indices were standardised to have an OECD mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Nonetheless, one should be cautious when comparing countries’ and economies’ means in these indices as cross-cultural comparability is not always  guaranteed. 
female	Gender variable: 1 if student is female, 0 if student is male.
ICT resources	"Items used to measure index: ""Educational software"",  ""A link to the Internet"", ""E-book readers (e.g. <KindleTM>, <Kobo>, <Bookeen>)"", ""<Tablet computers> (e.g. <iPad®>, <BlackBerry® PlayBookTM>)"", ""Computers (desktop computer, portable laptop, or notebook)"", ""<Cell phones> with Internet access (e.g. smartphones)""."
Home educational resources	"Items used to measure index: ""A desk to study at"", ""A quiet place to study"", ""A computer you can use for school work"", ""Educational software"", ""Books to help with your school work "", ""A dictionary""."
Perception of difficulty	Students were asked about their perception of difficulty of the PISA test (PISADIFF, ST163). Responses were given on a four-point Likert scale with the categories “Strongly disagree”, “Disagree”, “Agree”, and “Strongly agree”.
Meaning in life	PISA 2018 asked students (ST185) to report the extent to which they agree ( “strongly agree”, “agree”, “disagree”, “strongly disagree”) with the following statements: “My life has clear meaning or purpose”; “I have discovered a satisfactory meaning in life”; and “I have a clear sense of what gives meaning to my life”. These statements were combined to form the index of meaning in life (EUDMO). Positive values in the index indicate greater meaning in life than the average student across OECD countries.
ESCS	The PISA index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) was derived, as in previous cycles, from three variables related to family background: parents’ highest level of education (PARED), parents’ highest occupational status (HISEI), and home possessions (HOMEPOS), including books in the home.
Cultural possessions	"Items used to measure index: ""Classic literature (e.g. <Shakespeare>) "", ""Books of poetry"", ""Works of art (e.g. paintings)""."
Value of school	The index of value of school (ATTLNACT) was constructed based on a trend question (ST036) asking students whether they agree ( “strongly disagree”, “disagree”, “agree”, “strongly agree”) with the following school-related statements: “Trying hard at school will help me get a good job “; “Trying hard at school will help me get into a good <college>”; and “Trying hard at school is important”. Positive values on this scale mean that the student valued schooling to a greater extent than the average student across OECD countries.
Attitudes towards competition	The index of attitudes towards competition (COMPETE) was constructed using students’ responses to a new question (ST181) over the extent they “strongly disagreed”, “disagreed”, “agreed” or “strongly agreed” with the following statements: “I enjoy working in situations involving competition with others”; “It is important for me to perform better than other people on a task”; and “I try harder when I’m in competition with other people”. Positive values on this scale mean that students expressed more favourable attitudes towards competition than did the average student across OECD countries.
Teacher enthusiasm	PISA 2018 asked (ST213) students whether they agree ( “strongly agree”, “agree”, “disagree”, “strongly disagree”) with the following statements about the two language-of-instruction lessons they attended prior to sitting the PISA test: “It was clear to me that the teacher liked teaching us”; “The enthusiasm of the teacher inspired me”; “It was clear that the teacher likes to deal with the topic of the lesson”; and “The teacher showed enjoyment in teaching”. These statements were combined to create the index of teacher enthusiasm (TEACHINT). Positive values in this index mean that students perceived their language-of-instruction teachers to be more enthusiastic than did the average student across OECD countries.
Stimulation of reading engagement	The index of teachers’ stimulation of reading engagement (STIMREAD) was constructed based on a trend question (ST152) from PISA 2009 (ID in 2009: ST37) asking students how often ( “never or hardly ever”, “in some lessons”, “in most lessons”, “in all lessons”) the following occur in their language-of-instruction lessons: “The teacher encourages students to express their opinion about a text”; “The teacher helps students relate the stories they read to their lives”; “The teacher shows students how the information in texts builds on what they already know”; and “The teacher poses questions that motivate students to participate actively”. Positive values on this scale mean that the students perceived their teacher to provide greater stimulation than did the average student across OECD countries.
Disciplinary climate	The index of disciplinary climate (DISCLIMA) was constructed using students’ responses to a trend question about how often ( “every lesson”, “most lessons”, “some lessons”, “never or hardly ever”) the following happened in their language-of-instruction lessons (ST097): ” Students don’t listen to what the teacher says”; “There is noise and disorder”; “The teacher has to wait a long time for students to quiet down”; “Students cannot work well”; and “Students don’t start working for a long time after the lesson begins”. Positive values on this scale mean that the student enjoyed a better disciplinary climate in language-of-instruction lessons than the average student across OECD countries. Values in the index of disciplinary climate are directly comparable between PISA 2009 and PISA 2018 (see note 1 for more details).
Self-efficacy	PISA 2018 asked (ST188) students to report the extent to which they agree ( “strongly disagree”, “disagree, “agree”, “strongly agree”) with the following statements about themselves: “I usually manage one way or another”; “I feel proud that I have accomplished things”; “I feel that I can handle many things at a time”; “My belief in myself gets me through hard times”; and “When I’m in a difficult situation, I can usually find my way out of it”. These statements were combined to create the index of self-efficacy (RESILIENCE). Positive values in this index mean that the student reported higher self-efficacy than did the average student across OECD countries.
Fear of failure	Students in PISA 2018 were asked to report the extent to which they agree ( “strongly disagree”, “disagree”, “agree”, “strongly agree”) with the following statements (ST183): “When I am failing, I worry about what others think of me”; “When I am failing, I am afraid that I might not have enough talent”; and “When I am failing, this makes me doubt my plans for the future”. These statements were combined to create the index of fear of failure (GFOFAIL). Positive values in this index mean that the student expressed a greater fear of failure than did the average student across OECD countries.
Understanding and remembering	The PISA 2018 questionnaires included three scenarios assessing students’ knowledge of strategies for “Understanding and remembering” (undrem, ST164), “Summarising” (metasum, ST165) and “Assessing credibility” (metaspam, ST166). Metaspam was newly  developed for PISA 2018. Each scenario consists of (a) a stem which is a reading task and  (b) a set of strategies. Students were asked to rate how useful the strategies were for solving the reading task. All strategies were also rated by reading experts via multiple pairwise comparisons. This rating resulted in a hierarchy of all strategies for each task based on all the pairs agreed upon by at least 80% of the experts. For the new metaspam scenario (based on question ST166), for example, the experts’ ratings resulted in the following order: Q02HA, Q04HA, Q05HA > Q01HA, Q03HA. The final scores assigned to each student for each task ranges from 0 to 1 and can be interpreted as the proportion of the total number of expert pairwise relations that are consistent with the student ordering. The higher the score, the more a student chose an expert-validated strategy over a less useful one. Finally, all three indices were standardised to have an OECD mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Nonetheless, one should be cautious when comparing countries’ and economies’ means in these indices as cross-cultural comparability is not always  guaranteed. 
Wealth	"Items used to measure index: ""A room of your own"", ""A link to the Internet"", ""A dishwasher (country-specific) "", ""A <DVD or VCR> player (country-specific)"", ""Cellular phones"", ""Televisions"", ""Computers"", ""Cars"" and three country specific items"
Learning goals	Students in PISA 2018 were asked (ST208) to respond how true ( “not at all true of me”, “slightly true of me”, “moderately true of me”, “very true of me”, “extremely true of me”) the following statements are for them: “My goal is to learn as much as possible”; “My goal is to completely master the material presented in my classes”; and “My goal is to understand the content of my classes as thoroughly as possible”. These statements were combined to construct the index of learning goals (MASTGOAL). Positive values in the index indicate more ambitious learning goals than the average student across OECD countries.
Adaptive instruction	The index of adaptive instruction (ADAPTIVITY) was constructed using students’ responses to a new question developed for PISA 2018 (ST212). Students reported how often ( “never or almost never”, “some lessons”, “many lessons”, “every lesson or almost every lesson”) the following things happened in language-of-instruction lessons: “The teacher adapts the lesson to my class’s needs and knowledge”; “The teacher provides individual help when a student has difficulties understanding a topic or task”; and “The teacher changes the structure of the lesson on a topic that most students find difficult to understand “. Positive values on this scale mean that students perceived their language-of-instruction teachers to be more adaptive than did the average student across OECD countries.
Home possessions	In PISA 2018, students reported the availability of 16 household items at home (ST011), including three country-specific household items that were seen as appropriate measures of family wealth within the country’s context. In addition, students reported the amount of possessions and books at home (ST012, ST013). HOMEPOS is a summary index of all household and possession items (ST011, ST012 and ST013).
Motivation to master tasks	PISA 2018 asked students (ST182) to report the extent to which they agree ( “strongly disagree”, “disagree”, “agree”, “strongly agree”) with the following statements about themselves: “I find satisfaction in working as hard as I can”; “Once I start a task, I persist until it is finished”; “Part of the enjoyment I get from doing things is when I improve on my past performance”; and “If I am not good at something, I would rather keep struggling to master it than move on to something I may be good at”. The first three statements were combined to create the index of motivation to master tasks (WORKMAST). Positive values in the index indicate greater motivation than the average student across OECD countries.
Positive feelings	PISA 2018 asked students (ST186) to report how frequently ( “never”, “rarely”, “sometimes”, “always”) they feel happy, lively, proud, joyful, cheerful, scared, miserable, afraid and sad. Three of these positive feelings – happy, joyful and cheerful – were combined to create an index of positive feelings (SWBP). Positive values in this index mean that the student reported more positive feelings than the average student across OECD countries. An index of negative feelings was not created because of the low internal consistency of the index across PISA-participating countries.
Enjoyment of reading	The index of enjoyment of reading (JOYREAD) was constructed based on a trend question (ST160) from PISA 2009 (ID in 2009: ST24) asking students whether they agree ( “strongly disagree”, “disagree”, “agree”, “strongly agree”) with the following statements: “I read only if I have to”; “Reading is one of my favourite hobbies”; “I like talking about books with other people”; “For me, reading is a waste of time”; and “I read only to get information that I need”. Positive values on this scale mean that the student enjoyed reading to a greater extent than the average student across OECD countries. Scores of the index of enjoyment of reading are directly comparable between PISA 2009 and PISA 2018 (see note 1 for more details).
Teacher support	The index of teacher support (TEACHSUP) was constructed using students’ responses to a trend question (ST100) about how often ( “every lesson”, “most lessons”, “some lessons”, “never or hardly ever”) the following things happen in their language-of-instruction lessons: “The teacher shows an interest in every student’s learning”; “The teacher gives extra help when students need it”; “The teacher helps students with their learning”; and “The teacher continues teaching until the students understand”. Positive values on this scale mean that students perceived their teacher to support them more frequently than did the average student across OECD countries.
Perception of competence	The index of perception of competence in reading (SCREADCOMP) was derived from the following three statements: “I am a good reader”; “I am able to understand difficult texts”; and “I read fluently”. 
Parents’ emotional support	The index of parents’ emotional support (EMOSUPS) was constructed based on a trend question (ST123) asking students whether they agree ( “strongly disagree”, “disagree”, “agree”, “strongly agree”) with the following statements related to the academic year when they sat the PISA test: “My parents support my educational efforts and achievements”; “My parents support me when I am facing difficulties at school”; and “My parents encourage me to be confident”. Positive values on this scale mean that students perceived greater levels of emotional support from their parents than did the average student across OECD countries.
Teacher-directed instruction	The index of teacher-directed instruction (DIRINS) was constructed from students’ reports on how often ( “never or hardly never”, “some lessons”, “most lessons”, “every lesson”) the following happened in their language-of-instruction lessons (ST102): “The teacher sets clear goals for our learning”; “The teacher asks questions to check whether we have understood what was taught”; “At the beginning of a lesson, the teacher presents a short summary of the previous lesson”; and “The teacher tells us what we have to learn”. Positive values on this scale mean that students perceived their teachers to use teacher-directed practices more frequently than did the average student across OECD countries.
